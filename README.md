# AI Money Mentor

Personal financial planning web app: calculators, India-focused tax education, portfolio charts, and a **rule-based on-device “AI” advisor** — built with **Python** and **Streamlit** (no external LLM or API keys).

## Features

- **Profile inputs**: age, income, expenses, savings, SIPs, EMI, goals (house / car / retirement / emergency)
- **Money health score** (0–100) with actionable tips
- **SIP calculator** (future value, gains)
- **Retirement corpus** estimate and **FIRE** number with rough years-to-FIRE
- **Emergency fund** target and gap
- **Risk profile** (low / medium / high) with equity range hints
- **India tax-saving pointers** (80C, NPS, 80D, etc.) — educational, not professional advice
- **Monthly surplus allocation** breakdown
- **Plotly charts**: wealth projection, SIP horizons, portfolio scenarios, savings analysis
- **AI advisor** (`offline_ai.py`): chat, 12-month plan, simple explanations — **fully offline**
- **Couple Mode**: Partner A + B inputs → combined household profile, joint health score, couple risk rules, income-split pie, joint goals, combined budget & retirement tabs
